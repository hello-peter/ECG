>2.Data is introduced  :
>a 20-hour long ECG recorded from a 48- year-old male with severe congestive heart failure. This record has 17,998,834 data points containing 92,584 heartbeats.
The data description address is `[data description][1]`

mode:  
>---lstm.py 
>---vae.py
>---vae_lstm.py  



Train mode function file:
>train_lstm.py contains functions to train LSTM mode
>train_vae.py contains functions to train VAE mode
>train_vae_lstm contains functions to train VAE_LSTM mode

introduce vae_lstm:
>VAE_LSTM is to input the hidden variable Z generated by the VAE coding layer after training into the modified LSTM model to mine the characteristics of the whole data and time series

Test accuracy:
>LSTM only : 95.2953%
>VAE_LSTM : 97.2973%
